"Summer Moved On" is a song by A-ha which became their first single in more than six years. The album Minor Earth Major Sky was released in the UK on 22 May 2000, having been released in much of Europe on 27 March. The song was originally hastily written after A-ha agreed to a one-time reunion at the Nobel Peace Prize concert in 1998. There had been a lot of bad feelings between the band members, and each was hesitant to reunite.[citation needed] The thunderous success at the concert in performing only two songs inspired the band to reunite after a four year hiatus to record their sixth album for release in 2000. This song became a #1 radio hit in much of Europe, and the band has continued to record and perform together to significant international success, though that success has not extended to the U.S., where their recent work has gone unreleased. The song sold 2,500,000 copies worldwide.
